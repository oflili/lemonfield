<h2>[Core Service]</h2>
<p><strong>1. Narrative and Atmosphere Design</strong></p>
<p>The architecture of how your game feels - where tension rises, where silence speaks, where the environment tells the story your dialogue can't.</p>
<p>
➤ Atmospheric Integration Blueprint (10-20 page design document)
<ul>
<li>Audio direction & silence mapping</li>
<li>Environmental narrative placement strategy</li>
<li>Typography & visual tone guidelines</li>
<li>Tension escalation architecture</li>
<li>Implementation timeline with technical notes</li>
</ul>
➤ Emotional pacing architecture (scene-by-scene breakdown)
<ul>
<li>Psychological rhythm map for key moments</li>
<li>Player state progression tracking</li>
<li>Crescendo/valley placement for optimal impact</li>
<li>Integration with existing game systems</li>
</ul>
➤ Narrative Tension Mapping (visual diagram + written guide)
<ul>
<li>Where tension appears (silence, combat, ambient, BGM, environment)</li>
<li>How it builds, peaks, and releases</li>
<li>Player immersion triggers and psychological anchors</li>
<li>System-narrative synchronization points</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>2. Narrative Consultation (Concept + System Direction)</strong></p>
<p>Direct access to strategic narrative thinking for your project. Not hand-holding - surgical precision on what's broken and how to fix it consultation + follow-up documen.</p>
<p>
➤ Core Premise Refinement - Is your narrative concept strong enough to carry the game? Does it have structural integrity?
➤ Emotional Logic Mapping - Do your character motivations actually make psychological sense, or are they "video game logic"?
➤ Player Experience Goals - What should players feel at each stage? Are your mechanics supporting or betraying that?
</p>

<p><strong>3. Interactive Structure</strong></p>
<p>The systems that make your story playable - not cutscenes, but the mechanical expression of narrative (format in flowcharts + technical documentation + example scripting).</p>
<p>
➤ Dialogue Tree Architecture - Branching logic, emotional state tracking, consequence design
➤ Choice Consequence Structure - What choices matter, how they ripple, when players feel the weight  
➤ Emotional State Tracking Logic - How the game "remembers" player actions and shifts tone accordingly
➤ Variable-Based Narrative Flow - Technical implementation guide for dynamic storytelling  
</p>  

<p><strong>4. Lore & World Building</strong></p>
<p>The sistematic fragments that give your world soul rather than explain it. Environmental storytelling that players piece together, not wiki entries (format in Google Doc with categorized content + style guide).</p>  
<p>
➤ Environmental Text - What's written on walls, signs, objects that tells story through implication
➤ Object Descriptions - Items that carry emotional weight and backstory without exposition dumps
➤ Thematic Fragments - Lore pieces that establish tone and mystery without over-explaining
➤ Tonal Consistency Guide - How to keep your world's voice unified across all writing  
</p>
