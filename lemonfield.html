<h1>Lemonfield</h1>

<p>Narrative Atmospheric & System Design</p>
<p><strong>Where atmosphere breathes, silence speaks, and every choice leaves a mark.<strong/></p>

<hr>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>1. Interface Fragments</h2>
  
<div class="block">
<p class="meta">
<strong>Function:</strong><br> Short in-game prompts that shape atmosphere through environmental hints rather than explicit instructions. These create curiosity-driven engagement that increases session length and encourages players to explore rather than rush.</p>
<p class="meta">
<strong>System Logic:</strong><br> Fragments dynamically trigger based on proximity, player actions, and fluctuating psychological states (sanity).</p>

<div class="example">
● “Whisper to those flowers, they will give you an answer”
</div>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong><br> Proximity trigger. Text fades in UI corner for 3 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>System Response:</strong><br> Mic input → flowers bloom → hidden path revealed.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br> Voice experimentation. World feels responsive and alive.</p>

<div class="example">
● “A reflection with different eyes, don't stare too long”
</div>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong><br> Mirror approach trigger. Whispered audio with reverb, text appears in reflection.</p>
<p><strong>System Response:</strong><br> Stare 5+ seconds → reflection moves independently. Continue → sanity drop or threat spawns. </p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br> Tension through curiosity. Risk/reward observation gameplay.</p>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>2. Symbolic Object Description</h2>
    
<div class="block">
<p class="meta">
<p><strong>Function:</strong><br> Objects serve as narrative vessels to convey backstory and emotional stakes without relying on cutscenes. This approach deepens player attachment to characters and world while reducing production costs.</p>
<p><strong>System Logic:</strong><br> Descriptions and physical states change based on player discovery, acting as triggers for non-linear storytelling.</p>

<div class="example">
● Rusty Necklace -> Rusted with dry blood, but the pendant surface is smooth. Maybe the symbol is more meaningful than life itself 
</div>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong><br>Inventory item. Examine mode reveals rotating 3D view of the symbol.</p>
<p><strong>System Response:</strong><br>Proximity to specific locations → memory flashback triggers. Use in dialogue → unlocks unique conversation branches.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>Anchors character backstory. Emotional weight drives player investment in narrative.</p>

<div class="example">
● Half burnt letter -> A secret that bled from touch 
</div>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong><br>Collectible document. Partially readable text, charred edges obscure key words.</p>
<p><strong>System Response:</strong><br>Cross-referencing with other clues reveals hidden subplots. Specific light sources (UV) reveal obscured text.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>Mystery deepens. Players fill narrative gaps, project meaning, theorize connections.</p>
  
  <div class="section">
  <h2>3. Lore</h2>

<div class="block">
<p class="meta">
<p><strong>Function:</strong><br> Fragments of forgotten memory that establish the thematic foundation for moral decay and cyclical fate—narrative pieces that don't explain the world, but haunt it.</p>
<p><strong>System Logic:</strong><br> Narrative fragments that serve as the psychological blueprint for world-state shifts and player perception, subtly recontextualizing events as players uncover them.</p>

<div class="example">
● “Written pages have returned to their prologue. The bitten rage starts writing its own log”
</div>
<p><strong>Theme:</strong><br> Cyclical fate, surveillance, and the erosion of agency.</p>
<p><strong>Integration:</strong><br> Loop mechanics. NPC develop “ghost” memories, altering their dialogue to reflect past playthroughs. Subtle world-state shifts per cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br> Breaks player trust. The narrative forces a confrontation between perceived control and systematic predestination.</p>

<div class="example">
● “Their sin whisper in spring, now they dancing with the wind”
</div>
<p><strong>Theme:</strong><br> Guilt, false redemption, and inevitable consequence.</p>
<p><strong>Integration:</strong><br> Wind-physics spirits tied to moral tracking and choice. Environmental decay and spirit frequency scale based on irreversible player decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br> Lingering emotional weight. Atmosphere of regret, not punishment.</p>
