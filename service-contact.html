<h2>[Core Service]</h2>
<p><strong>1. Narrative and Atmosphere Design</strong></p>
<p>The architecture of how your game feels - where tension rises, where silence speaks, where the environment tells the story your dialogue can't.</p>
<p>
➤ Atmospheric Integration Blueprint (10-20 page design document)
<ul>
<li>Audio direction & silence mapping</li>
<li>Environmental narrative placement strategy</li>
<li>Typography & visual tone guidelines</li>
<li>Tension escalation architecture</li>
<li>Implementation timeline with technical notes</li>
</ul>
➤ Emotional pacing architecture (scene-by-scene breakdown)
<ul>
<li>Psychological rhythm map for key moments</li>
<li>Player state progression tracking</li>
<li>Crescendo/valley placement for optimal impact</li>
<li>Integration with existing game systems</li>
</ul>
➤ Narrative Tension Mapping (visual diagram + written guide)
<ul>
<li>Where tension appears (silence, combat, ambient, BGM, environment)</li>
<li>How it builds, peaks, and releases</li>
<li>Player immersion triggers and psychological anchors</li>
<li>System-narrative synchronization points</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>2. Narrative Consultation (Concept + System Direction)</strong></p>  
<p>Direct access to strategic narrative thinking for your project. Not hand-holding - surgical precision on what's broken and how to fix it (format in consultation + follow-up document).</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Premise Refinement - Is your narrative concept strong enough to carry the game? Does it have structural integrity?</li>
<li>Emotional Logic Mapping - Do your character motivations actually make psychological sense, or are they "video game logic"?</li>
<li>Player Experience Goals - What should players feel at each stage? Are your mechanics supporting or betraying that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Interactive Structure</strong></p>
<p>The systems that make your story playable - not cutscenes, but the mechanical expression of narrative (format in flowcharts + technical documentation + example scripting).</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialogue Tree Architecture - Branching logic, emotional state tracking, consequence design</li>
<li>Choice Consequence Structure - What choices matter, how they ripple, when players feel the weight</li>
<li>Emotional State Tracking Logic - How the game "remembers" player actions and shifts tone accordingly</li>
<li>Variable-Based Narrative Flow - Technical implementation guide for dynamic storytelling</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Lore & World Building</strong></p>
<p>The sistematic fragments that give your world soul rather than explain it. Environmental storytelling that players piece together, not wiki entries (format in Google Doc with categorized content + style guide).</p>  
<ul>
<li>Environmental Text - What's written on walls, signs, objects that tells story through implication</li>
<li>Object Descriptions - Items that carry emotional weight and backstory without exposition dumps</li>
<li>Thematic Fragments - Lore pieces that establish tone and mystery without over-explaining</li>
<li>Tonal Consistency Guide - How to keep your world's voice unified across all writing</li>  
</ul>

  <br>

<h2>[Strategic Framework]</h2>
<p>Deep-dive deconstruction of what's working and what's not - in your game or competitors'. The kind of analysis that appeared in my Love and Deepspace breakdown (10-20 page analysis document with actionable recommendations).</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic Analyses - Reverse-engineering how successful games manipulate player emotion (similar to the LDS audio analysis)</li>
<li>Systemic Design Papers - Does your current narrative design actually serve your goals? What's broken?</li>
<li>Emotional Retention Frameworks - How to keep players psychologically invested session-to-session</li>
<li>Design Risk Audits - What narrative/atmospheric choices might backfire? Where are you vulnerable?</li>
</ul>

  <br>

<h2>[Package]</h2>
<p><strong>Narrative Foundation Package</strong></p>
<p>Perfect for early-stage projects that need conceptual clarity before production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Core premise refinement (2 consultation sessions)</li>
<li>3 character psychological profiles with emotional arc mapping</li>
<li>Narrative tension map for 5 key scenes</li>
<li>Atmospheric integration blueprint (condensed version)</li>
<li>2 rounds of revisions</li>
</ul>  
  
<p><strong>Full Atmospheric Suite</strong></p>
<p>Comprehensive narrative design for indie games ready for production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete emotional pacing architecture</li>
<li>Interactive narrative structure with dialogue trees</li>
<li>Lore & environmental storytelling content</li>
<li>Audio direction & silence mapping</li>
<li>Tension escalation system</li>
<li>Implementation support (4 consultation calls during development)</li>
</ul>
