  <h2>Title: The Last Chapter</h2>
  <h2>Status: Narrative prototype / Interactive fiction</h2>  
  <h3>Technical Contribution</h3>
  <ul>
<li>Systems Design: Built the branching structure and choice logic within Twine (Harlowe).</li>
<li>Full Narrative Suite: Wrote and edited all passages, focusing on atmospheric pressure and psychological states.</li>
<li>Asset Creation:Designed custom visual integrations (handwritten letters) and composed original ambient music (BandLab).</li>
<li>UX/Presentation: Developed basic styling to ensure the interface reflects the narrative's tone.</li>
  </ul>  
  <h3>Design Intent</h3>
<p><strong>The Last Chapter is a short interactive narrative built in Twine. It explores agency, belief, and repetition through player choice, looping structure, and fragmented text. The story intentionally blurs beginning and ending, asking the player to reflect on their role as an observer and participant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The experience is designed to be intentionally disorienting. Choices do not always yield clarity, mirroring the core theme of unreliable perception. The looping structure reinforces a meta-narrative: the story begins before the player realizes they are already trapped within it.</strong></p>

<h2>Title: Sealed World </h2>
<h2>Status: Narrative prototype / Short-form adventure (in development)</h2>
<h3>Technical Contribution</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concept & Systems Design:</strong></li> Designed a short, self-contained progression centered on exploration, logic-based challenges, and narrative gating.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Structure:</strong>Developing a companion-driven journey where story progression is revealed through fragmented lore, environmental cues, and limited interactions rather than linear exposition.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Scope:</strong>Intentionally constrained to a brief playable segment, structured as a “frozen” state of a longer journey to emphasize mood, theme, and design intent over content volume.</li>
<li><strong>Solo Development:</strong>All narrative design, visual direction, and audio prototyping are created independently.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Desin Intent:</h3>
<p><strong>Sealed World explores the idea of progress without resolution. Rather than delivering a complete arc, the experience is designed to pause mid-journey, leaving the world partially understood and deliberately unresolved.
Mechanics prioritize interpretation over mastery. Combat, puzzles, and logic function as parallel methods of engagement, reflecting the central theme that no single system is sufficient to resolve contamination or belief-driven conflict.
This prototype focuses on atmosphere, restraint, and cohesion as a portfolio piece, demonstrating design decision-making under limited scope and resources.</strong></p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p><strong>This project is ongoing and developed alongside other short-form works as part of a broader exploration of narrative systems and player perception.</strong></p>
