<p>
Narrative Atmospheric & System Design
</p>

<hr>

  <h2>1. Interface Fragments</h2>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Short in-game prompts that shape atmosphere through environmental hints rather than explicit instructions.</p>
<p><strong>System Logic:</strong> Fragments dynamically trigger based on proximity, player actions, and fluctuating psychological states (sanity).</p>

<p>
• “Whisper to those flowers, they will give you an answer”
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Proximity trigger. Text fades in UI corner for 3 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>System Response:</strong> Mic input → flowers bloom → hidden path revealed.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Voice experimentation. World feels responsive and alive.</p>

<p>
• “A reflection with different eyes, don't stare too long”
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Mirror approach trigger. Whispered audio with reverb, text appears in reflection.</p>
<p><strong>System Response:</strong> Stare 5+ seconds → reflection moves independently. Continue → sanity drop or threat spawns. </p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Tension through curiosity. Risk/reward observation gameplay.</p>

  <h2>2. Symbolic Object Description</h2>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Objects serve as narrative vessels to convey backstory and emotional stakes without relying on cutscenes.</p>
<p><strong>System Logic:</strong> Descriptions and physical states change based on player discovery, acting as triggers for non-linear storytelling.</p>
